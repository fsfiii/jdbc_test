jdbc perf test between jruby and java

Quick small JDBC performance test between jruby and java using the same
code where possible.  Initial profiling work I've done seems to indicate
that the jruby bottleneck is almost exclusively in the get_string calls.

java seems to consistently process records between 2x-4x faster

$ ./run_jruby 
1000000 rows processed in 9 seconds (111111.11 recs/s)

$ ./run_java 
1000000 rows processed in 3 seconds (333333.0 recs/s)
