jdbc perf test between jruby and java (and clojure)

Quick small JDBC performance test between jruby and java using the same
code where possible.  Initial profiling work I've done seems to indicate
that the jruby bottleneck is almost exclusively in the get_string calls.

java seems to consistently process records between 2x-4x faster

$ ./run_jruby 
2000000 rows processed in 15 seconds (130932.90 recs/s)

$ ./run_java 
2000000 rows processed in 7.18 seconds (278551.53 recs/s)

$ ./run_clojure
2000000 rows processed in 15.744 seconds (127032.52032520325 recs/s)
